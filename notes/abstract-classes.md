# Abstract Classes

- Can't be used to create an object directly
- Only used as a parent class
- Can contain real implementation for some methods
- The implemented methods can reer to other methods that don't actually exist yet (stil must provide names and types for the un-implemented methods)
- can make child classes promise to implement some other method
